# NEA-Project

## Description
I found my college NEA Project on an old pc and uploaded it to github as is (with a few minor changes to hide email credentials, see below). 

The project I made was a database and sql focused project using Windows Forms that is made to replicate a restaurant ordering system using McDonalds as the example restaurant. It also includes admin features a system like this may contain.

## Usage
If you want to clone this repo you will need a gmail to use the email functions in the project.

See NEA Project/App.config.sample and create your own App.config following that template.

## My thoughts
Looking through this project I can see I have come a long way since college when it comes to good programming practices, with this project being written when I was a naive beginner programmer, and therefore, this repo should only be used for inspiration and not a template for a good codebase or a reflection of my current level.

I plan to also share a lot of the documentation that went into the making this project at some point when I clean it up.

I may in the future work on this project to improve its looks and refactor the code.
